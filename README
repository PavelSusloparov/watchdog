        - Watch on apache process. Restart apache if it is down.
        - Watch on Test Run Service log. Mail to administrator if service has ERROR messages.
        - Get system metrics.

        ToDo List:
            - Implement mail sending.
            - Properly handle system metrics. Write them to database. Create daily database backup under cron.
        The system is pretty raw now. It is test task, so the main goal was watchdog_service.py
        TRS is a little more complicated with apache configuration, but they are blocks for one system.
